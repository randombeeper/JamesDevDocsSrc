            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initially I goofed around with getting the Docusaurus site into GH using two different repos, one for the site source and one for the build directory. After goofing with that for a little bit, I stumbled upon the command to deploy to a different branch within your repo:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npm run deploy</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This automatically publishes your build to the branch <code>gh-pages</code> which GH Pages is also easily tuned into. This was the way to go.</p>
<p>GitHub Deployed! Look for the tutorial soon.</p>
<h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
<p>After commiting my site into GH as well as publishing the static contents to the 2nd branch, it was time to setup GH Pages. This is easily configured within your GH repo under settings-&gt;pages. Use "Deploy from a branch" and set the Branch to "gh-pages". Within a few minutes the site will be live and you'll see a button on the page to visit it.</p>
<p>GitHub Pages Deployed! Look for the tutorial soon.</p>
<h1>DocSearch</h1>
<p>Now that I've got an actual doc site on the internet, it's time to set up a search mechanism using Algolia DocSearch. Visit <a href="https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/</a>, put in the URL of the doc site, your email, your GH repo from previous step, and submit the form. Provided you meet all the criteria you'll be accepted into the program.</p>
<p>That's all for today...</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I recently joined Algolia as Senior Program Manager for DocSearch (and other programs too). I'm a firm believer that hands on experience is the ultimate way to increase knowhow and as program manager for DocSearch, that's the first thing I wanted to do. So, this blog will detail the process I went through as a complete newcomer to DocSearch. As an added bonus, this site is also going to serve as the actual input for the DocSearch I create! As I go, I will be able to create more content, which will require me to learn more about DocSearch, which will require me to write more about it. Win win!]]></description>

I'm a firm believer that hands on experience is the ultimate way to increase knowhow and as program manager for DocSearch, that's the first thing I wanted to do. So, this blog will detail the process I went through as a complete newcomer to DocSearch. As an added bonus, this site is also going to serve as the actual input for the DocSearch I create! As I go, I will be able to create more content, which will require me to learn more about DocSearch, which will require me to write more about it. Win win!</p>
<p>Short bio - went to school for computer engineering, focused on JAVA for my first few professional years, switched jobs, maintained an internal website based on PHP for the QA team of a C++ application. Lots of C++, Python, PHP/C#, more JAVA, and years later, I started doing more management than coding. Following that while part of a technical sales team, I coded more at the desktop UI level with MFC/WPF/.NET to show developers how to implement C++ libraries for the desktop. After that came a long string of more managerial/director roles that, while I had to manage technical people, kept me from doing technical things for most the time. So while I have a pretty deep technical knowledge pool to pull from, I've been out of the game for awhile. All the latest web tech stack stuff is pretty new to me in terms of hands-on.</p>
<p>Come with me to implement DocSearch on a new doc site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Publish a doc site that uses DocSearch" src="https://randombeeper.github.io/JamesDevDocsSrc/assets/images/devdocsite-d3cc34d9790e793949720a70e7ef579c.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Before I went too far, I thought it would be good to make an outline of what I was trying to acheive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a developer doc site</li>
<li>Create a DocSearch application with index</li>
<li>Implement a frontend UI for searching the index</li>
<li>Make updates to the doc site</li>
<li>Update the index</li>
<li>See the changes reflected in the UI</li>
<li>Improve the process overall as I learn more<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Refine index and utilize more Algolia features as I go</li>
<li>Refine the search UI experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Deploy a doc site with Docusaurus</h1>
<p>My first inclination was to create a website based on Hugo. The reason for Hugo was that I knew it had a big supportive community and figured that could be a good place to start. Keep in mind that while I have a technical background I didn't want to spend too much time over engineering an entire custom doc site and deployment mechanism. I'm looking to get up and running as fast as possile. Knowing that, I did switch gears to Docusaurus as I had heard within Algolia that we had out-of-the-box integration.</p>
<p>Docusaurus deployed! Checkout the tutorial on that soon.</p>
<p>That's all for today...</p>]]></content:encoded>
