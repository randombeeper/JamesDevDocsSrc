Lots of C++, Python, PHP/C#, more JAVA, and years later, I started doing more management than coding. Following that while part of a technical sales team, I coded more at the desktop UI level with MFC/WPF/.NET to show developers how to implement C++ libraries for the desktop. After that came a long string of more managerial/director roles that, while I had to manage technical people, kept me from doing technical things for most the time. So while I have a pretty deep technical knowledge pool to pull from, I've been out of the game for awhile.
