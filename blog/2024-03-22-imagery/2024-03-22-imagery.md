By now I have sent this site to different people over slack and I keep seeing this being shown in my message:

![alt text](image.png)

<!--truncate-->

I've never thought about this before but I wanted to update three things that I'm seeing
* the little image
* the blurb of text that is shown
* the big image

At this point I asked myself, "Where are these pieces of information even coming from?" So I set out to learn more and found this write up: https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254. I quickly learned a few things:

* It's called "unfurling"
* There are meta tags detailing what is being shown

Seeing that my source of knowledge was now seven years old and more specifically, I wanted to know exactly how Slack was unfurling my link, I found this: https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/link-unfurling, which went into more detail about what was happening in Slack. Funny enough, that article then included an image from the previous article above. Must have been a good one.





That's all for today...
